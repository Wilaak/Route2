## Install

Install with composer:

    composer require wilaak/route2

Or simply include it in your project:

```PHP
require '/path/to/Route2.php'
```

Requires PHP 8.3 or newer

## Quick Start

Here's a basic getting started example:

```php
<?php

require '../vendor/autoload.php';

use Wilaak\Http\Route2;

function send_json_response($data, int $status = 200): void {
    header('Content-Type: application/json');
    http_response_code($status);
    echo json_encode($data);
}

// Instantiate the router, it will automatically detect the request method and URI unless you provide them
// $router = new Route2($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'], $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']);
$router = new Route2();

$router->before(function() {
    header('X-Powered-By: Route2');
});

$router->group('/api', function($router) {
    $router->get('/hello/{name?}', function($name = 'World') {
        send_json_response(['message' => "Hello, $name!"]);
    });

    // Handle cases where the method is not allowed or the route is not found for all requests that begin with /api
    if ($router->allowedMethods) {
        header('Allow: ' . implode(', ', $router->allowedMethods));
        send_json_response([
            'error' => 'Method Not Allowed',
            'allowed_methods' => $router->allowedMethods
        ], 405);
    } else {
        send_json_response(['error' => 'Not Found'], 404);
    }
    exit;
});

$router->group('/admin', function($router) {
    $router->get('/dashboard', function () {
        ?>
            <h1>Admin Dashboard</h1>
            <p>Welcome to the admin dashboard!</p>
        <?php
    });
});

// Global fallback for routes that do not match any defined route
if ($router->allowedMethods) {
    header('Allow: ' . implode(', ', $router->allowedMethods));
    http_response_code(405);
    ?>
        <h1>Method Not Allowed</h1>
        <p>The requested method is not allowed for this URL.</p>
        <p>Allowed methods: <?=implode(', ', $router->allowedMethods)?></p>
    <?php
} else {
    http_response_code(404);
    ?>
        <h1>Not Found</h1>
        <p>The requested URL was not found on this server.</p>
    <?php
}

```

## How does it work?

Route2 follows a very dumb and simple approach: when you define routes, each incoming request is checked against your route patterns in the order they were registered. As soon as a matching route is found it executes the associated handlers, and then it dies‚Äîensuring only the first match is handled.

Could it be more optimized? Yes. Is it fast enough for most use cases? Yes.

## What is a Handler?

You'll see the term **handler** mentioned throughout this document. But what does it mean? In Route2, a handler is simply a reference to the function or method that will be executed.

You can define handlers in a variety of ways:

- **Anonymous Function (Closure)**  
    Pass an inline function directly:
    ```php
    function () { echo 'Greetings!'; }
    ```

- **Named Function**  
    Reference a global function by its name as a string:
    ```php
    'greeting'
    ```

- **Static Class Method**  
    Use the `ClassName::method` string format to call a static method:
    ```php
    'StaticController::greeting'
    ```

- **Instance Method (Array Syntax)**  
    Provide an array with the class name and method; the class will be instantiated for you:
    ```php
    [ObjectController::class, 'greeting']
    ```

### Hooking Into the Handler

You can intercept or customize how handlers are executed by using a handler hook. This is especially useful for integrating features like dependency injection, logging, or custom pre-processing.

To set a handler hook, use the `setHandlerHook()` method. The hook receives the handler and its parameters, allowing you to control how the handler is invoked:

```php
$router->setHandlerHook(function(array|callable $handler, array $params): callable {
    // Add your custom logic here (e.g., resolve dependencies, log calls, etc.)
    return is_array($handler)
        ? fn() => (new $handler[0])->{$handler[1]}(...$params)
        : fn() => $handler(...$params);
});
```

Routes added afterwards will inherit this new way of executing handlers.

## Basic Routing

Define routes by specifying the HTTP method, the URI pattern, and the [handler](#what-is-a-handler) to execute when the route matches.

```php
$router->get('/greeting', function() {
    echo 'Greetings!'
});
```

### Available Methods

The router allows you to register routes that respond to any HTTP verb:

```php
$router->get($uri, $handler);
$router->post($uri, $handler);
$router->put($uri, $handler);
$router->patch($uri, $handler);
$router->delete($uri, $handler);
$router->options($uri, $handler);
```

### Multiple HTTP-verbs

Sometimes you need to register a route that responds to multiple HTTP-verbs. You can do so using the `match()` method. Or, you can even register a route that responds to all HTTP verbs using the `any()` method:

```php
// Specify your own methods
$router->match(['GET', 'POST'], '/', 'handler');
// For GET and POST methods
$router->form('/', 'handler')
// Matches all HTTP methods
$router->any('/', 'handler');
```

## Route Parameters

Often, you'll want to capture parts of the URL as variables‚Äîsuch as a user's ID or a post slug. Route parameters make this easy and flexible.

### Required Parameters

These parameters must be provided or the route is skipped.

```php
$router->get('/user/{id}', 'handler');
```

You can define as many required parameters as required by your route:

```php
function handler($post, $comment) {
    echo 'Showing post:' . $post . ' and comment: ' . $comment;
}

$router->get('/posts/{post}/comments/{comment}', 'handler');
```

### Optional Parameters

Specify a route parameter that may not always be present in the URI. You may do so by placing a `?` mark after the parameter name.

>**Note**: Must be the last segment. Make sure to give the route's corresponding variable a default value:

```php
function handler($name = 'John') {
    echo $name;
}

$router->get('/user/{name?}', 'handler');
```

### Wildcard Parameters

Capture the whole segment including slashes by placing a `*` after the parameter name.

>**Note**: Must be the last segment. Make sure to give the route's corresponding variable a default value:

```php
function handler($any = 'Empty') {
    echo $any;
}

$router->get('/somewhere/{any*}', 'handler');
```

### Parameter Expressions 

You can enforce specific formats for your route parameters by using the `expression()` method. This method accepts an associative array where the keys represent parameter names, and the values can either be a regex pattern or a [handler](#what-is-a-handler).

- **Regex**: Ensures the parameter matches the specified pattern. If not, the route will be skipped.
- **Handler**: The [handler](#what-is-a-handler) receives the parameter value as its argument. It should return `true` to allow the parameter, `false` to skip the route, or any other value to assign it directly to the parameter.

Routes added after this method will inherit the expressions.

```php
$router->expression([
    // By specifying #^ ... $# you are telling the expression to use regex
    'id' => '#^[0-9]+$#',
    // Uses handler to verify that the value of id is numeric
    'id' => 'is_numeric',
    // Uses handler to transform the parameter value
    'name' => 'strtoupper'
]);
```

## Middleware

Middlewares are like filters or layers that process HTTP requests before and after they reach your application's core logic. Think of them as checkpoints‚Äîeach middleware can inspect, modify, or even halt a request. For example, an authentication middleware might redirect unauthenticated users to a login page, while letting authenticated users continue.

> **Note**: Middleware are only executed when a matching route is found. If a middleware handler returns `false`, the script will terminate.

You can add middleware to your routes using the `before()` and `after()` methods. These methods accept a [handler](#what-is-a-handler).

Once a middleware is registered, all routes defined afterwards will inherit them.

```php
// Register middleware that runs before the handler
$router->before('your_middleware_handler');
// Register middleware that runs after the handler
$router->after('your_middleware_handler');
// Routes defined below will inherit the middleware
```

## Route Groups

Route groups make it easy to organize related routes and share common attributes‚Äîsuch as middleware or parameter expressions‚Äîacross multiple routes. Groups can be nested, and nested groups automatically inherit attributes from their parent, much like variable scopes.

To group routes under a common prefix, use the `group()` method. All routes defined within the group will share the specified prefix and any attributes you assign:

```php
$router->group('/admin', function ($router) {
    // This middleware only affect routes within this group and its children
    $router->before('admin_middleware_handler');
    $router->get('/dashboard', 'admin_dashboard_handler');
    $router->post('/settings',  'admin_settings_handler');
});
```

You can also create a group without a prefix by omitting the first argument and using the `callback` named argument. This is useful for sharing route attributes without affecting the route path:

```php
$router->group(callback: function ($router) {
    // ...
});
```

## Hide Script Name from URL

Want to remove the script name (like `index.php`) from your URLs for cleaner, more user-friendly links? Here‚Äôs how you can achieve this with different web servers:

### FrankenPHP

[FrankenPHP](https://frankenphp.dev), the modern PHP app server, hides `index.php` from URLs by default. No extra configuration is needed.

### NGINX

To hide `index.php` in NGINX, add the following to your server block. This configuration ensures that requests not matching an existing file or directory are routed to `index.php`:

```nginx
location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
}
```

### Apache

First, ensure `mod_rewrite` is enabled (on Unix: `a2enmod rewrite`). Then, add this snippet to your `.htaccess` file. It will redirect all requests for non-existent files or directories to `index.php`:

```apache
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php/$1 [L]
```
